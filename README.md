# conways-game-of-life
This repository features John Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulation. Programmed in C and run in the console, it was developed as my final project for the Fundamentals of Programming course in my first semester. Clone, compile, and run the simulation to explore its rules and behavior.
